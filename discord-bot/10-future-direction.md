# Future Direction

The **[Subscrypts Discord Bot](https://discord.onsubscrypts.com)** already lets communities run automated, on-chain subscriptions directly in Discord. Looking ahead, the focus is on three main themes:

1. **Better UX** for both server admins and members  
2. **Deeper insight and control** through analytics and alerts  
3. **Tighter alignment** with the evolving Subscrypts smart contracts and dApp

This page outlines where the Discord Bot is heading and how it fits into the broader Subscrypts roadmap.

---

## 1. UX Improvements for Admins & Members

Future updates aim to make the bot easier to understand and operate, especially for people who are new to Web3.

### Admin-side UX

Planned enhancements include:

- **Richer Admin Guide UI** in `#subscrypts-admin`  
    - Step-by-step checklists (“what to do next”)  
    - Inline explanations when something fails (e.g., missing permission, role order issue)  
    - One-click “fix it” actions where safe (re-run baseline, repair channels, recheck mappings)

- **Guided wizards for common tasks**  
    - “Set up my first paid tier” (create plan → map role → gate channels)  
    - “Add a new tier” (clone patterns from existing mappings)  
    - “Review my setup” (quick health check across roles, channels, mappings, and reconciliation)

The aim is that a Discord admin with minimal crypto experience can still configure everything confidently, without having to read the full technical docs.

### Member-side UX

On the member side, planned improvements focus on:

- **Clearer in-Discord messaging**  
    - Friendlier explanations when linking fails or when no active subscription is found  
    - Better guidance on next steps (“tap here to subscribe”, “check this channel for help”)

- **Mobile-first flows**  
    - Shorter messages and fewer steps for mobile users  
    - Better handling of cases where the Discord client or mobile browser behaves differently

Taken together, these changes are intended to make the **[Subscrypts Discord Bot](https://discord.onsubscrypts.com)** feel intuitive even to members who have never used a blockchain product before.

## 2. Admin Observability, Dashboards & Alerts

As more merchants and communities join Subscrypts, the need for **visibility and reporting** grows. The Discord Bot will increasingly act as the front door into richer analytics hosted in the **[Subscrypts dApp](https://app.subscrypts.com)**.

### Guild-level dashboards

Planned dashboards (surfaced via the dApp, but fed by the same smart contracts and bot) include:

- **Per-guild subscription overview**
    - Active subscriptions by plan and by role  
    - New subscriptions vs. cancellations over time  
    - High-level revenue indicators (e.g., “monthly subscription volume” per guild)

- **Plan-level breakdown**
    - Which tiers are most popular  
    - How many members upgraded or downgraded in a period  
    - Basic churn indicators

The **[Subscrypts Discord Bot](https://discord.onsubscrypts.com)** will guide admins to these dashboards (for example via links in `#subscrypts-admin`) so they can move from “something seems off” to “here is what’s really happening” in a few clicks.

### Alerts & health signals

Planned improvements include:

- **Guild health summaries**  
    - “All good” vs. “Some mappings missing” vs. “Frequent reconciliation errors”
- **Optional alerts** (configurable per guild)  
    - Repeated failures to apply roles (permission issues, role order, or missing roles)  
    - Large spikes in failed payments or cancelled renewals  
    - Subscription events that might warrant an announcement (e.g., hitting a subscriber milestone)

These alerts will help admins react quickly when something goes wrong, without having to constantly watch logs or dashboards.

---

## 3. Member Transparency & Cross-Guild View

On the subscriber side, the roadmap includes a more complete view of a user’s subscriptions across the ecosystem, primarily in the **[Subscrypts dApp](https://app.subscrypts.com)**:

- A **“My Subscrypts”** view where members can see:
    - Which guilds they are subscribed to  
    - Which plan is active in each guild  
    - When each subscription renews or ends  
    - Direct links back to the relevant per-guild subscription pages

The **[Subscrypts Discord Bot](https://discord.onsubscrypts.com)** will remain focused on per-guild access and messaging, but will increasingly **link members to these cross-guild overviews** so they can manage everything from a single, Web3-native hub.

---

## 4. Reliability, Scaling & RPC Efficiency

As Subscrypts grows, the infrastructure behind the Discord Bot must scale smoothly while remaining trustworthy.

Future work in this area includes:

- **Smarter reconciliation scheduling**
    - Prioritizing guilds and users with recent changes  
    - Avoiding unnecessary checks when nothing has changed on-chain

- **More robust RPC usage**
    - Using **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** providers efficiently to query on-chain data  
    - Balancing event-driven updates with periodic “sanity checks”  
    - Making sure that even under heavy load, decisions are always based on **fresh, authoritative on-chain data**

- **Horizontal scaling & fault tolerance**
    - Spreading reconciliation and webhook handling across multiple workers  
    - Gracefully handling temporary outages (Discord API rate limits, RPC timeouts)  
    - Ensuring that “eventual consistency” is maintained even when one component is temporarily slow or unavailable

These improvements are about making sure that, as the ecosystem grows, the bot remains **fast, predictable, and reliable** — from small private servers to large communities with many tiers.

## 5. Smart-Contract–Driven Features at the Bot Layer

The **[Subscrypts Discord Bot](https://discord.onsubscrypts.com)** is an application layer on top of the same smart contracts described in the **Smart Contract Suite** docs. As new on-chain features are introduced, the bot will be updated to expose them in Discord.

Some of the **conceptual** smart contract enhancements described in the broader roadmap  that could influence the bot include:

- **Volume subscriptions & licensing**
    - One subscription powering multiple “seats”  
    - For Discord, this could become: one on-chain subscription → multiple members granted roles in a guild (for teams, families, or organizations)

- **More flexible renewal models**
    - Smarter handling of renewals and fallback payment paths  
    - For the bot, this means clearer messages when a renewal fails, and better prompts to help users fix it

- **Account abstraction & UX improvements**
    - Exploring patterns like **ERC-4337** to reduce friction (e.g., fewer gas-related errors for end-users)  
    - The Discord Bot would guide users into these improved flows when they become available in the dApp and contracts.

- **Advanced analytics and reporting hooks**
    - On-chain structures that make it easier to aggregate subscription data  
    - The bot and dApp can then use these to offer deeper analytics without compromising privacy or decentralization

All such features will follow the same path described in the **Smart Contract Future Development** docs: design → security review → compliance assessment → staged rollout. Only once something is live on-chain will it be surfaced through the **[Subscrypts Discord Bot](https://discord.onsubscrypts.com)**.

For more detail on the smart contract roadmap, see:

- **[Smart Contract – Future Development](../smart-contract/16-future-development.md)**

## 6. Ecosystem & Integration Outlook

Looking further ahead, the bot is expected to become an even stronger **bridge between Web2 communities and Web3 subscriptions**, with possibilities such as:

- **Better webhooks and external integrations**
    - Allowing merchants to connect their own tools (CRM, analytics, or support systems) to subscription events
- **Richer dApp ↔ Discord handoffs**
    - Deep links from guild dashboards back to specific Discord contexts (e.g., “open this user’s private thread” or “view this plan’s announcement channel”)
- **Optional helper bots or AI-driven assistants**
    - To answer common questions, detect misconfiguration patterns, and suggest best practices — all while keeping core subscription logic on-chain and non-custodial

Any such integrations will be designed to keep the **blockchain as the single source of truth** and to respect the non-custodial, privacy-preserving principles at the heart of Subscrypts.

## 7. Why This Matters

For **merchants and Discord admins**, this roadmap means:

- More **control and insight** without extra manual work  
- Tools that scale with their community size and revenue  
- Confidence that access control is driven by verifiable on-chain logic

For **subscribers**, it means:

- Clearer **visibility into their subscriptions** across guilds  
- Consistent, predictable experiences when linking wallets and subscribing  
- The freedom to participate using self-custodial wallets, across borders, without traditional banking barriers
