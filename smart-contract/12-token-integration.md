# Token Integration — SUBS Token

The **SUBS Token** is the native ERC-20 token of the Subscrypts ecosystem. It serves as the settlement medium for all on-chain transactions and subscription payments while maintaining interoperability with stablecoins such as **USDC**. The SUBS token ensures that economic activity across the platform remains transparent, decentralized, and utility-driven.

This section explains how the SUBS token integrates into the contract suite, powers subscription settlements, and interacts with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for liquidity and quoting.

---

## Overview and Purpose

The SUBS token underpins the Subscrypts economy by providing:

- **Settlement utility** — used for payments between subscribers and merchants.
- **Economic alignment** — ensuring value accrues within the ecosystem rather than to intermediaries.
- **Liquidity pairing** — integrated with USDC to enable price stability and fair quoting.

Unlike speculative tokens, SUBS functions as a **utility and settlement asset**, directly linked to the platform’s operational logic.

---

## Token Standard and Implementation

SUBS conforms to the **ERC-20 Upgradeable** standard, extending OpenZeppelin’s `ERC20Upgradeable` contract for compatibility with the UUPS proxy architecture.

Key properties:

- **Name:** Subscrypts Token
- **Symbol:** SUBS
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Type:** ERC-20 upgradeable
- **Deployed Network:** Arbitrum One

It inherits all standard ERC-20 methods (`transfer`, `approve`, `allowance`) while supporting internal hooks for payment processing within `FacetSubscription` `FacetPaymentUSDC`.

## Token Economics and Utility Cycle

The **SUBS Token** powers a self-sustaining and transparent economic cycle within the Subscrypts ecosystem. It is not a speculative-only asset but a **utility token** with continuous real-world demand and supply generated by subscription activity.

### The Economic Flow

1. **Subscribers** acquire SUBS (often converting from USDC) to pay for their subscriptions.
2. **Merchants** receive SUBS as payment for their services or products.
3. **Merchants** can either:

   * Convert SUBS back to **USDC or other stable assets** to cover operational costs.
   * **Hold SUBS** to benefit from long-term platform growth and future ecosystem incentives.
4. Over time, as adoption increases, this recurring demand for SUBS (through user payments) and periodic selling (by merchants) establishes a healthy token velocity.

The result is an **organic value cycle** driven by usage, not speculation. Token demand grows naturally as more subscriptions are created and renewed, while liquidity ensures stability for real-world settlements.

### Future Incentives and Utility Expansion

While the current token model focuses on **settlement and liquidity**, future iterations may include:

* **Staking incentives** for merchants or long-term holders.
* **Reduced commission fees** or added perks for merchants holding a specific minimum balance of SUBS.
* **Discounted network fees** for recurring subscribers maintaining a wallet balance above a threshold.

These mechanisms aim to reward participants who actively contribute to the ecosystem’s stability and growth.

This cyclical model keeps the Subscrypts economy dynamic and utility-driven — every token movement represents real economic activity, making SUBS both functional and sustainable.

## Token Flow in Subscription Settlement

The **SUBS token** is the universal settlement currency within the Subscrypts ecosystem. Regardless of whether a plan is defined in SUBS or USDC, **all payments ultimately settle in SUBS**, ensuring predictable merchant revenue and unified accounting.

### How Settlement Works

1. **Direct SUBS Payment** — When the subscriber calls `subscriptionCreate(planId)` for a SUBS-based plan, payment is performed directly in SUBS with no conversion.
2. **USDC Quoted Payment** — For USDC-based plans, if the subscriber calls `subscriptionCreate(planId)`, the contract retrieves a **real-time quote** from Uniswap to determine the SUBS equivalent and deducts that amount directly from the subscriber’s SUBS balance.
3. **USDC-to-SUBS Conversion** — When using `paySubscriptionWithUsdc(planId)`, the **FacetPaymentUSDC** contract performs an **on-chain swap** from USDC → SUBS using the Uniswap Router, then calls `subscriptionCreate()` internally to complete payment and activate or renew the subscription.
4. **Settlement** — Once the SUBS payment is finalized, funds are transferred directly to the merchant’s wallet. No custodial wallet or intermediary holds user funds.
5. **Event Emission** — Events like `_subscriptionPay`, `_subscriptionCreate`, and `_subscriptionRecurring` are emitted, enabling off-chain synchronization across the **[Subscrypts dApp](https://app.subscrypts.com)**, the **[Discord Bot](https://discord.onsubscrypts.com)**, and third-party integrations.

### Visualized Flow

    PS->>M: Transfer SUBS amount

    PU->>DEX: Quote + Swap USDC → SUBS
    DEX-->>PU: Return SUBS

    PS->>M: Transfer SUBS payment
    PS-->>U: Emit _subscriptionPay & _subscriptionRecurring
  end
  PS-->>O: Events + View data for synchronization
```

This unified settlement logic ensures **atomic conversions**, **non-custodial transfers**, and **on-chain auditability**, regardless of the subscriber’s chosen payment currency.

## Token Liquidity and Uniswap Integration

To enable reliable conversions, SUBS maintains liquidity through a **SUBS/USDC pool** on **Uniswap V3**. The protocol interacts with three core Uniswap components:

- **Router:** Executes swaps between USDC and SUBS.
- **Quoter:** Retrieves price data for quoting during plan creation and payment estimation.
- **Position Manager:** Allows liquidity providers (LPs) to manage custom tick ranges and positions.

The `FacetSubscription` and `FacetPaymentUSDC` contracts integrates with these components to perform on-chain quoting and settlement using verified pool addresses.

---

## Conversion Functions and Logic

The **Subscrypts Smart Contract Suite** uses specialized conversion and pricing logic to ensure consistent and fair SUBS settlement across both USDC and SUBS-based plans.

Conversion and quoting are handled through two key modules:

* **FacetPaymentUSDC** — Responsible for quoting and performing real-time swaps using Uniswap.
* **FacetSubscription** — Handles subscription settlement logic using the median on-chain price for consistency and predictable merchant revenue.

| Function                                  | Module                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `quoteUsdcForSubs(uint256 amountUsdc)`    | **FacetPaymentUSDC**  | Retrieves a live quote from **Uniswap’s Quoter**, returning the expected SUBS output for a given USDC input. This value reflects real market swap rates including fees, slippage, and liquidity depth. |
| `paySubscriptionWithUsdc(uint256 planId)` | **FacetPaymentUSDC**  | Executes an on-chain **USDC → SUBS** swap at the quoted price via Uniswap, then calls `subscriptionCreate()` in **FacetSubscription** to complete the transaction in a single atomic operation.        |
| `convertOtherCurrencyToToken()`           | **FacetSubscription** | Performs internal conversion calculations for supported tokens based on the **mid-range Uniswap pool price**—a balanced rate used for consistent settlement and accounting.                            |
| `convertTokenToOtherCurrency()`           | **FacetSubscription** | Performs internal conversion calculations for supported tokens based on the **mid-range Uniswap pool price**—a balanced rate used for consistent settlement and accounting.                            |

**Quoting Logic:**

* The **FacetPaymentUSDC** module uses **Uniswap’s Quoter** for direct price discovery and conversion execution. The resulting price includes all DEX-related variables such as liquidity, swap fees, and price impact.
* The **FacetSubscription** module, on the other hand, uses **mid-range pool pricing** for settlements that do not involve active swaps. This ensures consistent pricing for recurring renewals and minimizes volatility effects.

By combining both quoting and mid-range settlement logic, Subscrypts ensures that users always pay a fair, verifiable rate, while merchants receive predictable and transparent payouts.

## Compliance and Regulatory Alignment

The SUBS token is explicitly defined as a **utility token** under the [MiCAR](https://subscrypts.com/whitepaper) framework. It does not represent a financial instrument or security.

Compliance features include:

- On-chain sanctions and freeze logic integrated into the payment flow.
- Transparent event logging for all transfers and conversions.
- Optional KYC/KYB alignment for merchants in regulated jurisdictions.

These mechanisms ensure lawful operation while maintaining user privacy and decentralization.

## Example Integration (Developers)

Developers can integrate the **SUBS** ERC-20 token into their dApps, bots, or backend services using any Web3 library. Below is a ready-to-use example with **ethers.js**.

```js
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import subsTokenAbi from "./abi/subsTokenAbiV1.json";

// 1. Set up provider and signer
const rpcUrl = "https://your-arbitrum-rpc-url";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl);

const subsTokenAddress = "0xYourSubsTokenAddress"; // SUBS ERC-20 contract
const privateKey = "0xYourPrivateKey"; // load from env/secret manager in real apps
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

// 2. Initialize the SUBS token contract
const subsToken = new ethers.Contract(subsTokenAddress, subsTokenAbi, signer);

async function main() {
  const walletAddress = await signer.getAddress();

  // Example 1: Check SUBS balance
  const balance = await subsToken.balanceOf(walletAddress);
  console.log(`Your SUBS balance: ${ethers.formatUnits(balance, 18)} SUBS`);

  // Example 2: Approve Subscrypts payment contract to spend SUBS
  const paymentContractAddress = "0xYourSubscryptsProxyOrPaymentAddress";
  const amountToApprove = ethers.parseUnits("50", 18); // approve 50 SUBS

  const approveTx = await subsToken.approve(paymentContractAddress, amountToApprove);
  const approveReceipt = await approveTx.wait();
  console.log("Approval transaction hash:", approveReceipt.hash);

  // Example 3: Send SUBS tokens to another wallet
  const recipientAddress = "0xRecipientWalletAddress";
  const amountToSend = ethers.parseUnits("5", 18); // send 5 SUBS

  const transferTx = await subsToken.transfer(recipientAddress, amountToSend);
  const transferReceipt = await transferTx.wait();
  console.log("Transfer transaction hash:", transferReceipt.hash);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```
