# Introduction

**Subscrypts** is a blockchain-based subscription management platform that enables merchants and creators to offer subscription services with crypto payments managed by smart contracts. Its core purpose is to modernize recurring payments by eliminating traditional intermediaries (like banks or payment processors) and providing users with greater **privacy, control, and security**.

Instead of relying on credit cards or bank debits, subscriptions on Subscrypts are handled entirely through **SUBS**, an Ethereum-based utility token.

## Why It Matters

Traditional subscription systems come with several limitations:

- High failure rates due to expired cards or payment denials.
- Expensive fees from multiple intermediaries.
- Geographic and banking barriers that limit who can subscribe.
- Limited transparency and user control.
- **Extensive collection of personal data** — often stored by multiple third parties, increasing exposure to data breaches.

Subscrypts addresses all of these by leveraging smart contracts that:

- Automate recurring payments without needing trusted third parties.
- Allow users to maintain custody of funds until each payment.
- Provide a verifiable, on-chain record of transactions.
- Enable borderless access — anyone with a crypto wallet can subscribe.
- **Preserve user privacy** — no personal data (like name, address, or card details) is required to subscribe or pay. This minimizes exposure to data leaks and enhances safety for both users and merchants. (Some jurisdictions may still require merchants to collect limited information for compliance reasons, but Subscrypts itself does not store or handle personal user data.)

## The Role of the SUBS Token

At the center of the Subscrypts economy is **SUBS**, an ERC-20 utility token deployed on **Arbitrum One**, a Layer-2 network built on Ethereum. Arbitrum offers:

- Low transaction fees.
- High throughput for microtransactions.
- Full Ethereum security compatibility.

All subscription payments and platform fees are settled in SUBS, aligning the token’s usage directly with the platform’s core function. Importantly:

- **SUBS does not represent ownership, voting rights, or dividends.**
- It is not a speculative asset, but a functional token for accessing services.

This token model keeps Subscrypts compliant with EU regulations while maintaining strong utility and user protection through decentralization and privacy.

## Built for Compliance

From the beginning, Subscrypts was designed with regulation in mind. Its official whitepaper was written to conform to the **EU Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)** regulation — ensuring:

- Clear disclosures for token holders.
- Transparent project purpose and structure.
- Explicit risk warnings.
- Compliance without compromising user privacy or data security.
